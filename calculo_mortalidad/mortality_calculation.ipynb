    "# Calculation of Mortality Rate – Demographic Flow Method  \n",
    "*(Argentina Example – Reverse Engineering Mortality from Population Balances)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Core Idea: Population as a Markov-like Flow System\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year, the total population changes due to four main flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_{t+1} = P_t + \\text{Births}_t + \\text{Immigration}_t - \\text{Emigration}_t - \\text{Deaths}_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- $P_t$ = Total population at the end of year $t$ (or beginning of $t+1$)  \n",
    "- $\\text{Births}_t$ = Live births registered during year $t$  \n",
    "- $\\text{Deaths}_t$ = Total deaths during year $t$ → **this is what we want to estimate**  \n",
    "- $\\text{Immigration}_t$ and $\\text{Emigration}_t$ = International migration flows  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the classic **demographic balancing equation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Solving for Mortality (Deaths)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have reliable data for $P_{t+1}$, $P_t$, births, and net migration (or separate immigration and emigration), we can rearrange the equation to isolate deaths:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\text{Deaths}_{t} = P_t + \\text{Births}_{t} + \\text{Immigration}_{t} - \\text{Emigration}_{t} - P_{t+1}\n",
    "}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, using **net migration** (Immigration − Emigration):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boxed{\n",
    "\\text{Deaths}_{t} = P_t + \\text{Births}_{t} + \\text{Net Migration}_{t} - P_{t+1}\n",
    "}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Estimating Deaths in 2023 (Argentina)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Deaths}_{2023} = P_{2022} + \\text{Births}_{2023} + \\text{Immigration}_{2023} - \\text{Emigration}_{2023} - P_{2023}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is especially useful when official death records are incomplete, delayed, or questionable (e.g., during pandemic years), but population estimates, births, and migration data are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Crude Mortality Rate (per 1,000 inhabitants)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have estimated deaths, the crude death rate (CDR) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{CDR}_{t} \\left( \\text{per 1,000} \\right) = \\frac{\\text{Deaths}_{t}}{\\text{Mid-year Population}_{t}} \\times 1000\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually we approximate mid-year population as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Mid-year Population}_{t} \\approx \\frac{P_t + P_{t+1}}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or use the official mid-year estimate when available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Why This Method Works Well for Argentina\n",
    "\n",
    "Argentina publishes:\n",
    "- Annual population estimates/projections by INDEC (usually December 31 or July 1)\n",
    "- Definitive birth series (Vital Statistics)\n",
    "- Migration estimates (often net migration from National Directorate of Migration + censuses)\n",
    "\n",
    "→ This gives us all the inputs needed to **back-calculate total deaths** with high accuracy, even before official mortality tables are released."
